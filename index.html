								<p>Hello, I'm <b>David</b>, and welcome to my page. I am a Software Developer and below you can check out some of my work. </p>
								<p> With this website, me and 3 other peers built a <b><a href="https://character-creator.herokuapp.com/">Character Creator</a></b>. The website allows users to log-in to their created accounts and from there answer a series of prompts that initiates their character's creation. The reason this project was created was to help aid story creators when blockers, creative paralysis and or writers block occures. This site helps in pushing our users out of that paralysis muck and on the way to the creativity train.</p>
								<p>This my <b><a href="https://davjhall.github.io/the-friendly-neighborhood-weatherman/">5 Day Forecast app</a></b>. It is a single page application that incorporates end points from a weather API. With it, I was able to display any city's 5 day forecast. That information specifically includes that city's highest temperature for each day, as well as it's wind and humidity.</p>
								<p> This is a <b><a href="https://arjunk-g.github.io/Project-1/">Currency Converter</a></b>. This is an application where I worked with a small team of 4 to use multiple APIs to convert different World currencies to various precious metals and Bitcoin. I was specifically assigned to the "Currency to Bitcoin" portion as well as the overall design flow of the site.</p>

								<p>Coding is truely a passion of mine! But when I'm not coding I thoroughly enjoy long trips on my Harley-Davidson. The open raod and a good raod trip are just as satisfying as finally getting your code to work.</p>
